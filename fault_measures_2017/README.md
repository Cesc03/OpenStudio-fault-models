# Representing Small Commercial Building Faults in EnergyPlus: Model Development

Small commercial buildings (those with less than approximately 1,000 m2 of total floor area) often do not have access to cost-effective automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tools for maintaining efficient building operations. AFDD tools based on machine-learning algorithms hold promise for lowering cost barriers for AFDD in small commercial buildings; however, such algorithms require access to high-quality training data that is often difficult to obtain.
