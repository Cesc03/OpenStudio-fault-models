# Project Files

This README describes the project files in this folder. The project files here are constructed based
on `template.xlsx` in the [OpenStudio Analysis Spreadsheet] repository. They define the measure
scripts, weather files, and building seed models to be simulated together as a project. They can be
configured to do parametric studies, building model calibration, generation of large data set for
data analytics, etc. The project files used to create the cases in the report are:

* `case2012_seb_report.xlsx`: Faulted cases in Site Entrance Building (SEB) Model
* `case2012_ec_waterchiller_report.xlsx`: Faulted cases in Modified Education Center (MEC) Building
  Model
