# Building Seed Models

This README describes the building seed models in this folder. These seed models are `.osm`
(OpenStudio building model) files. The models are used in this repository to demonstrate the
application of OpenStudio and EnergyPlus fault measures to OpenStudio models. In the published
report related to fault modeling, the following seed models are used:

* `SEB_160.osm`: Site Entrance Building (SEB) Model
* `EC_DifferentialEnthalpy_WaterChiller_160.osm`: Modified Education Center (MEC) Building Model
